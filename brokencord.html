								<h2>Broken Cord</h2>
								<h3>Engine: Godot</h3>
								<h3>Main Role: Programmer</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								<i>Broken Cord</i> is a rhythm-based dungeon crawler developed using the Godot Engine as a group project for my Game Development I course.  In this game, the player plays as a new bard who must move to the beat and play a combination of notes to cast spells.  The game follows the bard’s first mission as they must navigate a monster-filled dungeon to rescue a cat.

											<h3>DEMO</h3>
											My main focus when developing <i>Broken Cord</i> was the enemies' AI: enemy movement and collision detection, their attacks, and how they spawn in and out of a room when the player enters or leaves.  I also created the doors and keys, implemented all of the animations, and developed the camera, which follows the player between rooms.  Additionally, I collaborated with the other programmer in the team on the player’s movement.

								<h3>CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS</h3>
								My biggest challenge in <i>Broken Cord</i> was the player and enemy movement: how to change the position of an object, which is confined to a 16x16 pixel tile on the grid-based map, while maintaining collision.  To solve alignment issues and assure that characters moved one tile at a time, I chose to script their movement using a position-based approach rather than a velocity-based approach.
								<br><br>
								By using a position-based approach to movement, I could not rely on Godot's physics system to handle collisions, so I needed to account for collisions myself so to prevent characters from moving onto a tile that is already occupied by a collidable object or to prevent multiple characters from trying to move onto the same tile.  To address this issue, the player object was given priority over the enemies when moving.  When an enemy moves, it stores a target tile position and references this variable from all other enemies' to determine if this tile will still be available.  The order that the enemies move in is determined by the order that the Godot Engine calls the movement function.
