								<h2>Heist</h2>
								<h3>Engine: Unity</h3>

								<i>Heist</i> is a stealth game developed using Unity engine in a team of four for my Game Development I course.  In this game, the player is a thief tasked with stealing a special artifact and as many other items from a museum without getting caught by the museumâ€™s security.

											<h3>DEMO</h3>
											When developing <i>Heist</i>, one of my focuses was implementing the security system: the security guards that roam the museum, the security cameras that can rotate and scan the surrounding area, and the security terminal to temporarily deactivate the security cameras.  The script used by the security cameras were also used by the collectable artifacts, which also rotated.  I also designed the level, wrote the music, and created the sound effects.

								<h3>CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS</h3>
								One of my biggest challenges in <i>Heist</i> was designing a way to visualize the field of view of the security guards and the security cameras.  This would show what the security units can see and what the player should avoid moving into to prevent getting caught.  Due to the limited time on the project, the final version of <i>Heist</i> used a model of a cone as the field of view.  The field of view cone has a mesh collider, so when the player enters the collider, a raycast is made from the security guard or camera to the player.  This would determine if the player is hidden behind an object or is visible by the security.  
								<br><br>
								While not my area of expertise, also I worked on the sound design for <i>Heist</i>.  As I was unfamiliar with sound design, I learned how to use Ableton Live 11 to compose the music and Audacity to record and modify the sound effects.
