								<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
								<h3>Language: Prolog</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								In this assignment for my Programming Languages class, I wrote a program in Prolog in a team of two that implemented natural language processing.  
								<br><br>
								This program takes several definitions of processor attributes, each definition containing the processorâ€™s core count, area, and cost.  The program will also take constraints for each of these attributes.  
								<br><br>
								After the definitions and constraints are given, the program will compute and display how many of each processor can be placed on a chip so that the given constraints are satisfied.  

							</p>
							<p>
								<h3>DEMO</h3>
								When working on this assignment, I focused first on defining natural language grammars, which I used to extract the information from each given sentence and stored in a list asserted as new clauses into the database.  With the information about the processors and constraints, I wrote procedures to retrieve the processors and constraints and to verify that the constraints were met.

								<h3>CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS</h3>
								As this was one of my first times working with Prolog, the biggest challenge when working on this assignment was learning Prolog and understanding natural language processing.  Many of the challenges I faced as a result of this I solved by reading the Prolog documentation, searching on Google, and experimenting with different ideas to approach the problem.
