                                            The Pokémon Graph Application is a data visualization tool developed using the Unity 2D physics engine; programmed in C#.  <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/sqliter-20660">SQLiter</a> was used to query Pokémon databases using SQL.

                                            Nodes representing Pokémon types are spawned along the perimeter of the graph with Pokémon Nodes spawned between Type Nodes.  A Pokémon Node has edges connecting them to these Type Nodes presenting the types of that Pokémon.

								The Pokédex being used can be changed, which can allow us to limit our search to Pokémon available in a specific game.  To change a Pokédex, select the dropdown underneath  “POKÉDEX” and select the Pokédex you want to use.  By default, the national Pokédex, which contains all Pokémon, is set.  At the moment, we can select from the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (DP), Pokémon Platinum (Pt), Pokémon Black and White (BW), and Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 (B2W2) Pokédexes.

                                <div class="h4Inner">
                                    Pokémon Nodes are spawned at the midpoint between two Type Nodes. Spring joints are used to connect the Pokémon Nodes to their corresponding Type Nodes. Pokémon of the same type combination have collision enabled between them while Pokémon Nodes that do not have the same type combination will not. A slight attraction is placed on the Pokémon Nodes pulling them slightly towards the center of the graph through a point effector around the central point of the graph while an edge collider prevents the nodes from moving outside of the perimeter.  When all Pokémon are spawned in, the Type Nodes resize relative to the number of Pokémon that have that type.  Pokémon Nodes of the same type will group together in the same area of the graph.  
                                    <br><br>
                                    There are various ways to query Pokémon and add them to the graph.  You can select from Pokémon with a specific type combination, randomly select a given number of Pokémon, or select from all Pokémon in the current Pokédex.  You can further modify the search parameters with the toggles and dropdowns to the right of the search buttons.  These parameters allow you to, for example, search for Pokémon who do not evolve or exclude Legendaries and Mythical Pokémon.

If either Type 1 or Type 2 are left blank, the application will search for Pokémon with only the one type inputted.  The “...” option for Type 2 acts as a wild card.  It will search for all Pokémon that have the selected type for Type 1 in its Type combination.

                                        Sometimes, nodes may overlap each other or a node may move a lot due to physics.  Moving a node may not work as it will return to its previous position.  To fix the position of a node, press the control key and left-click the node.  This will freeze the X and Y positions of the node's rigid body.

                                        You can force connecting nodes to stay a fixed distance from a “parent” node by pressing shift and left-clicking the parent node.  Moving this parent node will also move its children nodes.  You can lock both Pokémon Nodes to a Type Node or Type Nodes to a Pokémon Node.  
                                        <br><br>
                                        To unlock the children nodes from their parent node, hold shift and left-clicking the parent node.  You can manually invert this locked state of a node by holding down shift and right-clicking on a node.  For example, if a child node is locked to a parent node, inverting its locked state will unlock the child node from its parent node.
